Program - http://www.digitalhumanities.lv/bssdh/2023/Programme/

*This information will be updated in the days leading up to the workshop.*

## Prerequisites

No experience with Python is expected.

Helpful but not required experience: 
* Jupyter Notebooks including Google Colab
* Experience with any other programming language

### Software requirements in the order of preference

1. Easiest - Any computer with modern browser and ability to connect to Google Colab (requires Google account - Gmail) - No local installation necessary
2. Locally installed Python Jupyter Notebooks - preferably use the [Anaconda Python installation](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

### Test software requirements

If you can run the above Notebook in enviroment of your choice (Google Colab, or locally) with no errors - you are ready for the workshop!

## Day 1 - 25.07.2023 - 11:00

### Python Essentials and Text Analysis with NLTK

In this introductory session, students will become acquainted with the versatile Jupyter Notebooks platform for Python programming. We will begin by exploring Python's fundamental data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Next, we will delve into text analysis by learning how to read, filter, and convert text files, as well as work with folders. By introducing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, students will gain hands-on experience in processing and analyzing textual data. This comprehensive first day will provide a strong foundation in Python and set the stage for more advanced topics on Day 2.

## Day 2 - 26.07.2023 - 11:00

### Data Manipulation and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

Building upon the foundation established on Day 1, this session will focus on data manipulation and visualization using the powerful libraries Pandas and Matplotlib. Students will learn how to load, filter, and transform data using Pandas DataFrames, as well as perform basic statistical analysis. We will then explore data visualization techniques, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs, by leveraging the capabilities of the Matplotlib library. By the end of Day 2, participants will have gained valuable skills in Python programming, enabling them to analyze and visualize real-world data sets with confidence and ease.
